rustByExampleExercises
======================

My exercises from the [rust by example](http://rustbyexample.github.io) book/tutorial/site.

```bash
#build (replace part1 with whatever file)
make TARGET=part1

#build and run
make run TARGET=part1

#build and debug with gdb
make debug TARGET=part1
```
